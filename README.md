# Credit Card Churn Prediction (ANN)

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict credit card customer churn. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using TensorFlow.

## Features

* Load and preprocess dataset
* Encode categorical variables
* Scale numerical features
* Build a multi-layer ANN using TensorFlow/Keras
* Train, validate, and evaluate model performance

## Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow / Keras

## Project Structure

* **Notebook:** `Credit_Card (1).ipynb`
* **Models:** ANN for binary classification

## Usage

1. Install required libraries
2. Open the notebook
3. Run each cell to reproduce preprocessing, training, and evaluation results

## Objective

To build an effective deep learning model that helps identify customers likely to churn, enabling better retention strategies.
